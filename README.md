# 🧞‍♂️ GenieTalk — Agentic AI Chatbot

GenieTalk is a **goal-driven Agentic AI chatbot** built using **Streamlit** and **Google Gemini API**.  
Unlike traditional chatbots that only respond to prompts, GenieTalk can **understand user goals, create a step-by-step plan, select appropriate tools, and execute tasks intelligently**.

This project demonstrates **real-world Agentic AI architecture**, tool orchestration, document-based reasoning, and role-based AI behavior.

  1. Understands the user goal  
  2. Creates a structured plan  
  3. Selects the right internal tools  
  4. Executes each step logically  
  5. Produces a clean final answer
